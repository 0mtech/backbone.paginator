**This project is being very heavily refactored. Please don't consider using until it's been officially released**

This project seeks to provide a stable, comprehensive pagination component for Backbone.js. Please try out the demo then take a look at backbone.paginator.js and the accompanying models, collections and views to see how it could be used.

##API

See ```backbone.paginator.js``` and ```backbone.paginator.config.js``` for comments and guides.

##Credits

The client-side paginator is based on base work by @bmsterling and the server-side + refactoring work (sort, extension) is by me. The idea is to eventually have solid client and server pagination components we can use with Backbone.

##Project status

I currently consider this work to be in an experimental phase. Once we've nailed down the structure of the pagination component, tests and further documentation will be added.

This project seeks to provide stable, comprehensive pagination components for Backbone.js. Currently a component for client-side data (i.e single data payloads) and one for server-data (i.e requerying/syncing for each new page of results) are available. Both also show how sorting, accessing specific pages, next/previous pages and more can be implemented.

##API/Demo

The demo project included shows how to use both ```backbone.paginator.client.js``` and ```backbone.paginator.server.js```. 


##Credits

* Server-data version and client-data refactor: @addyosmani
* Initial work on client-side version: @bmsterling

##Project status

I currently consider this work to be in an experimental phase. Once we've nailed down the structure of the pagination components, tests and further documentation will be added.

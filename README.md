##Backbone.Paginator 0.14

This project seeks to provide stable, comprehensive pagination components for Backbone.js. 

Currently a component supporting both request-level pagination (e.g pagination and sync of URLs requesting data from a server) and UI pagination of data in the client (e.g data returned from the server you wish to further paginate in the UI) is available. These are exposed via `Paginator.requestPager()` and `Paginator.clientPager()` respectively.

Examples showing pagination, sorting, item limits per page, next/previous navigation and more can be found in the `examples` folder.

##Docs

At the moment your best option is to read through the comments in backbone.paginator.js. I will be expanding these into proper docs shortly.

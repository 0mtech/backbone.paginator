**This project is being very heavily refactored. Please don't consider using until it's been officially released**

This project seeks to provide a stable, comprehensive pagination component for Backbone.js. Please try out the demo then take a look at backbone.paginator.js and the accompanying models, collections and views to see how it could be used.

##API

See ```backbone.paginator.js``` and ```backbone.paginator.config.js``` for comments and guides.

##Credits

This project is based on initial prior work on a paginator by @bmsterling and has been extended by @addyosmani in both the paginator and views to cover a few extra pieces (code cleanup, sort by fields, ajax/query pagination, requests etc.)

##Project status

I currently consider this work to be in an experimental phase. Once we've nailed down the structure of the pagination component, tests and further documentation will be added.

##Backbone.Paginator

This project seeks to provide stable, comprehensive pagination components for Backbone.js. Currently a component supporting both client-side data pagination (i.e for single data payloads) and one for multi-page server pagination (i.e requerying/syncing for each new page of results) is available. Examples showing how sorting, accessing specific pages, next/previous pages and more can be implemented are also included.

##Docs

At the moment your best option is to read through the comments in backbone.paginator.js. I will be expanding these into proper docs shortly.
